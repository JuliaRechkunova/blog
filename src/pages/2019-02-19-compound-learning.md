The compound effect is magical. Just look at these simple calculations:

```
1.01^365 = 37.7834343329
0.99^365 = 0.02551796445
```

So if you are improving just by 1% every day, in one year results are going to be much better than if you are slowing down by 1% every day. 

However, to learn does not mean to consume any information. It's about pushing your own limits towards your goals. Even if little by little.

I think it's important to ask yourself questions like:

- The topic I'm learning, will it help me with achieving my goals? Can I use it as a base to acquire more knowledge?
- For how long can it be useful/actual? Does it make sense to focus on fast-changing topics?
- Can I learn something fundamental regarding this topic which can still matter in the next couple of years?
- How can I remember what I've learned without relying on computers/devices memory? 

Any tiny improvements are important and valuable if they are done regularly and in the right direction.
