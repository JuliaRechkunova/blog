Hi there!

My name is Julia and it looks like I'm starting my personal blog about frontend, flutter and other favorite technologies.

I would like to use it as a playground for my experiments. For example, to build this simple "static" blog I used [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Graphql](https://graphql.org/). Crazy, right? But much fun. I hope you can find something interesting here for you too.

To be continued...
