[Daughter - The end](https://open.spotify.com/track/7zqhUgWpWzwYnT9eewPJEK?si=IlPbRLt8Qw6fO0omRWg_rg) song:
> This is the end
  This is the end
  You wait to find that I'm still here
  And you've been waiting for the light to shine
  Wake up, wake up, wake up
  I'll be the answer to the question
  I can't answer, it's a question
  You can't spit it out, can we find
  We find, we find a way out, a way out
  It's easier to understand
  We die, we're buried underground
  But I have stayed awake since then
  You tried to find a new best friend
  You instigate, come after chasing
  Oh, what the hell should I say, then?
  I've missed you
  Let's spend the future talking about the past
  How you said goodbye
  How I fucked your mind up
  We really are something else
  Let's say you were sent here
  Just to keep me in check
  My pulse is quick, my neck is stretched
  Whoever says I need to just
  Get over it, get over him
  Get over myself
  They say there's something in our sky
  We should pay attention
  I don't care to realize
  I'm too busy moping
  They say there's something in our seas
  We should all be careful
  I'm not swimming anyway
  I'm too busy moping
  They say there's something in my house
  That I should just get out, get out
  I don't want to be escaping
  No, I'm too busy moping around
  I'm too busy moping around
  I'm too busy moping around
  I'm too busy moping around
  I'm too busy moping around
  Take a run home, I don't like where you're going
  Run home, I don't like the words you're saying
  Run home, I don't like where you're going
  Run home, I don't like the words you're saying
  Take a run home, I don't like where you're going
  Run home, I don't like the words you're saying
  Run home, I don't like where you're going
  Run home, I don't like the words you're saying
